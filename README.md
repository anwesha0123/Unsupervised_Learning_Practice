# Unsupervised_Learning_Practice

Unsupervised Learning is a type of machine learning where a model learns patterns and structures from unlabeled data without explicit supervision. Unlike supervised learning, where the model is trained using labeled input-output pairs, unsupervised learning algorithms discover hidden patterns, group similar data points, or reduce dimensionality without predefined labels.

🚀 Projects Included: 
✅ Clustering: Customer segmentation, document clustering, image segmentation
✅ Dimensionality Reduction: PCA, t-SNE, UMAP for high-dimensional data visualization
✅ Anomaly Detection: Fraud detection, network intrusion detection, outlier analysis
✅ Association Rule Mining: Market basket analysis using Apriori & FP-Growth

⚙️ Tech Stack:
Python 🐍
Scikit-learn
TensorFlow/PyTorch
Matplotlib & Seaborn for visualization
Pandas & NumPy for data manipulation
