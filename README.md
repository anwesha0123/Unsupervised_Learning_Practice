# 📌 Unsupervised_Learning_Practice  🎯

Unsupervised Learning is a type of machine learning where a model learns patterns and structures from unlabeled data without explicit supervision. Unlike supervised learning, where the model is trained using labeled input-output pairs, unsupervised learning algorithms discover hidden patterns, group similar data points, or reduce dimensionality without predefined labels.

## 🚀 Projects Included  
✅ **Clustering:** Customer segmentation, document clustering, image segmentation  
✅ **Dimensionality Reduction:** PCA, t-SNE, UMAP for high-dimensional data visualization  
✅ **Anomaly Detection:** Fraud detection, network intrusion detection, outlier analysis  
✅ **Association Rule Mining:** Market basket analysis using Apriori & FP-Growth  

## ⚙️ Tech Stack  
- 🐍 **Python**  
- 📊 **Scikit-learn**  
- 🧠 **TensorFlow / PyTorch**  
- 📈 **Matplotlib & Seaborn** (for visualization)  
- 🗂️ **Pandas & NumPy** (for data manipulation)
